Enter information about the original data file in your Metadata Guide
The Metadata Guide is one of the three documents you created before you started working with your data.

Each time you obtain a new original data file, add a section about that file to the Metadata Guide.

Begin the section with a header that identifies the original data file it pertains to (e.g., “Metadata for penn_tables_1986_2010.txt”.)

Review the specifications for the Metadata Guide given in the TIER Protocol, then enter the relevant information about the original data file in your Metadata Guide.

If you enter the required information right away each time you obtain a new original data file, your Metadata Guide will be complete well before you finish your project.
